3. **Docker Compose**: Local development setup
4. **GitHub Actions**: Complete CI/CD pipeline including:
   - Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
   - Automated testing (unit, integration, container tests)
   - Security scanning (dependency, container, SAST)
   - Docker image building and testing
   - Container structure validation

## Focus Areas: Docker + CI/CD Integration

This repository specifically demonstrates:

### Docker Best Practices
- Multi-stage builds for production optimization

- **C++**: HTTP server with CMake, performance testing
- **Go**: Microservice with Redis, high-performance patterns

## Git Branching Strategy

This repository demonstrates a **production-ready Git workflow** with **ruthless branch management** and **strict CI/CD enforcement**:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

main           ←─── 🔒 PROTECTED (No direct pushes)
│              ←─── ✅ Ultra-strict CI (100% coverage required) 
│              ←─── 🚀 ALWAYS PRODUCTION-READY (latest Docker tag)
│              ←─── ⚡ DEPLOY TO FIELD WITH NO NOTICE
│
├── develop    ←─── 🔄 Integration branch (WIP)  
│   │          ←─── ✅ Comprehensive CI on push
│   │          ←─── 🚨 Strict CI on PR to main

│   ├── feature/user-auth     ⚡ TEMPORARY (deleted after merge)
│   ├── feature/api-v2        ⚡ TEMPORARY (deleted after merge)

```

### Branch Protection & CI Strictness Levels

| Branch | Direct Push | CI Requirements | Deployment |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| `main` | ❌ **BLOCKED** | 🚨 **Ultra-Strict**: 100% test coverage, zero vulnerabilities, container scan | 🚀 **Production (latest tag)** |
| `develop` | ❌ **BLOCKED** | ✅ **Comprehensive**: 95% coverage, security scan, quality gates | 📦 **Staging** |
| `feature/*` | ✅ Allowed | ⚡ **Basic**: 90% coverage, fast feedback | ❌ **None** |
| `hotfix/*` | ✅ Allowed | 🚨 **Ultra-Strict**: Same as main branch (production-ready) | ⚠️ **Emergency** |
| `bugfix/*` | ✅ Allowed | ⚡ **Basic**: 90% coverage, fast feedback | ❌ **None** |
| `docs/*` | ✅ Allowed | 📝 **Documentation**: Lint checks, link validation | ❌ **None** |

### Workflow Examples

```bash
# Feature Development (temporary branch)
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/new-api-endpoint
# ... make changes ...
git push -u origin feature/new-api-endpoint

# Create PR to develop (comprehensive CI) - NO DIRECT PUSH TO DEVELOP
gh pr create --base develop --title "Add new API endpoint"
# ⚡ Triggers comprehensive CI: 95% coverage, security scans

# After PR merge: RUTHLESS DELETION
git branch -d feature/new-api-endpoint
git push origin --delete feature/new-api-endpoint

# Release Process (ultra-strict CI) 
git checkout develop  
gh pr create --base main --title "Release v2.1.0"
# ⚡ Triggers ultra-strict CI: 100% coverage, zero vulnerabilities

# Hotfix Process (production emergency)
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-vulnerability
# ... fix critical issue ...
git push -u origin hotfix/security-vulnerability

# Direct PR to main (ultra-strict CI)
gh pr create --base main --title "HOTFIX: Critical security patch"
# ⚡ Same strict requirements as main branch
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git and GitHub account
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
- GitHub CLI (for testing workflows)
- Language-specific tools (varies by demo)

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvalancy-mt/training-materials.git
   cd training-materials
   ```

2. Start with the Python FastAPI demo (most beginner-friendly):
   ```bash
   cd demos/python-fastapi
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:8000/docs to see the API documentation

4. Study the `.github/workflows/` files to understand the CI/CD pipeline

5. **Experience the branching strategy**:
   ```bash
   # Create a feature branch (temporary!)
   git checkout -b feature/test-changes
   
   # Make some changes, push, and see the CI pipeline
   echo "# Test" >> test.md
   git add test.md && git commit -m "Test commit"
   git push -u origin feature/test-changes
   
   # Create PR and watch the CI/CD pipeline in action
   gh pr create --base develop --title "Test PR"
   ```

## 🚀 **Production-Ready Main Branch Philosophy**

### Key Principle: **Main = Always Deployable**

The `main` branch follows a **zero-notice deployment** philosophy:

- **✅ Always Production-Ready**: Every commit can be deployed to production immediately
- **🏷️ Latest Docker Tag**: All builds automatically tagged as `latest` in container registry  
- **⚡ Field Deployment**: Ready for immediate customer deployment with no additional testing
- **🛡️ Zero-Defect Policy**: Ultra-strict CI ensures no broken code ever reaches main
- **🔒 Immutable Quality**: 100% test coverage, zero security vulnerabilities, full container scan

### Why This Matters

```bash
# This should ALWAYS work without hesitation:
docker pull your-registry/app:latest
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 your-registry/app:latest

# Immediate customer deployment:
kubectl set image deployment/app app=your-registry/app:latest
```

**Everything in main is field-tested, security-validated, and production-proven.** 🎯
